* In newer versions of npm we need to explicitly include babel_core as a dev-dependncy
* Changing the config file so Bootstrap will allways load the Bootstrap 4.alpha2 - to not break layout - as the library is evolving.
* Including '-loader' to webpack loader config files - as in webpack 2 it is mandatory (although our project is running on webpack 1).
